You just bought a new tea kettle that is supposed to heat water to boiling in 2 minutes.

Let's say we run a 1 Sample T-Test on means for an exam. We expect the mean to be 75%, 
but we want to see if the actual scores are significantly better or worse than what we expected. 
After running the T-Test, we get a p-value of 0.25. What does this result mean?
>We cannot confidently reject the null-hypothesis, so we do not have enough data to say that the mean on this exam 
is different from 75%.


What kind of test would you use to see if men and women identify differently as "Republican", "Democrat", or "Independent"?

You regularly order delivery from two different Pho restaurants, "What the Pho" and "Pho Tonic".

If we perform an ANOVA test on 3 datasets and reject the null hypothesis, what test should we perform to determine
