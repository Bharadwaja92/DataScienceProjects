Dangers of Multiple T-Tests
Suppose that we own a chain of stores that sell ants, called VeryAnts. There are three different locations: A, B, and C. We want to know if the average ant sales over the past year are significantly different between the three locations.

At first, it seems that we could perform T-tests between each pair of stores.

We know that the p-value is the probability that we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis on each t-test. The more t-tests we perform, the more likely that we are to get a false positive, a Type I error.

For a p-value of 0.05, if the null hypothesis is true then the probability of obtaining a significant result 
is 1 â€“ 0.05 = 0.95. 
When we run another t-test, the probability of still getting a correct result is 0.95 * 0.95, or 0.9025. 
That means our probability of making an error is now close to 10%! This error probability only gets bigger with the 
more t-tests we do.
