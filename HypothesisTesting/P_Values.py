We have discussed how a hypothesis test is used to determine the validity of a null hypothesis. 
A hypothesis test provides a numerical answer, called a p-value, that helps us decide how confident we can be 
in the result. A p-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true.

A p-value of 0.05 would mean that there is a 5% chance that the null hypothesis is true. 
This generally means there is a 5% chance that there is no difference between the two population means.

Before conducting a hypothesis test, we determine the necessary threshold we would need before concluding that the 
results are significant. A higher p-value is more likely to give a false positive so if we want to be very sure that 
the result is not due to just chance, we will select a very small p-value.

It is important that we choose the p-value before we see the results. If we wait until after we see the results, 
we might pick our threshold such that we get the result we want to see. 
For instance, if we're trying to publish our results, we might set a p-value such that our results are significant. 
Choosing our p-value in advance helps keep us honest.

Generally, we want a p-value of less than 0.05, meaning that there is a less than 5% chance that our results are due to 
random chance.
