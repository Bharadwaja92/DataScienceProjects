Seaborn is a Python data visualization library that provides simple code to create elegant visualizations for 
statistical exploration and insight. Seaborn is based on Matplotlib, but improves on Matplotlib in several ways:

Seaborn provides a more visually appealing plotting style and concise syntax.
Seaborn natively understands Pandas DataFrames, making it easier to plot data directly from CSVs.
Seaborn can easily summarize Pandas DataFrames with many rows of data into aggregated charts.
