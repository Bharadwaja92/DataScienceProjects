KDE -  Kernel Density Estimator plot.

One of the most important tasks that Seaborn automates for us is calculating aggregate statistics over large datasets

What does the box in the center of the violin plot represent?       The interquartile range.

There are three keyword arguments that Seaborn's sns.barplot() always needs to create a bar chart. They are:
x, y and data

In Seaborn, bar charts are not able to visualize:  Distributions

Seaborn improves on Matplotlib by making it easier to plot data directly from CSVs, providing a more visually appealing 
plotting style, and:    easily summarizing Pandas DataFrames with many rows of data into aggregated charts.

Violin Plots are a combination of which of the following plots?   KDE plots and box plots

Standard deviation and bootstrapped confidence intervals are two measurements that can be used for:  Error bars
